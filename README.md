## Getting Started

3. Start your Wrangler development server: `wrangler dev`
4. The Cloudflare KV Explorer will appear in your Explorer sidebar
5. Click on any KV entry to view its contents

- Click any key to open its value in a new editor tab
- JSON values are automatically formatted

### Searching
- Click the search icon (üîç) in the toolbar
- Type to search across both keys and values
- Results appear instantly with value previews

## How It Works

The extension reads KV data from Wrangler's local SQLite databases located in `.wrangler/state/v3/kv/`. It automatically discovers all Workers in your workspace by finding `wrangler.toml` files and maps their KV namespace bindings to the local storage.

## Commands

- `Cloudflare KV Explorer: Search Keys` - Open the fuzzy search interface
- `Cloudflare KV Explorer: Refresh` - Reload all KV data
- `Cloudflare KV Explorer: Clear Search` - Reset search filters
- `Cloudflare KV Explorer: Compare Entries` - Compare two KV values

## Requirements

- VSCode 1.74.0 or higher
- Cloudflare Wrangler CLI installed
- Active Wrangler dev session with KV bindings

## Troubleshooting

### No KV data showing
- Ensure Wrangler dev server is running
- Check that your `wrangler.toml` has KV namespace bindings
- Verify KV data exists (add some test data if empty)

### Extension not activating
- Make sure you have a `wrangler.toml` file in your workspace
- Try manually opening the Cloudflare KV view in the Explorer sidebar

## Privacy

This extension only accesses local SQLite databases created by Wrangler. No data is sent to external servers.
